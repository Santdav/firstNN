Student Habits & Performance Analysis
This project is a Python-based data analysis tool designed to explore the relationship between student habits and academic performance. It features a modular architecture, starting with an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) suite and a flexible Main Menu for further analysis and machine learning tasks.

🚀 Features
Automated EDA: Quick generation of dataset statistics, info, and missing value checks.

Visual Distributions: Automatic histogram generation for all numerical features.

Modular Design: Easily extendable via a dictionary-based menu system to add new analysis modules or ML models.


🧹 Data Cleaning Process
Note to self: Describe your specific cleaning steps here.

Handling Missing Values: [e.g., Imputed median for study hours, dropped rows with missing IDs]

Data Transformation: [e.g., Normalized test scores using Min-Max scaling]

Outlier Detection: [e.g., Removed entries where 'sleep_hours' exceeded 24]

Feature Encoding: [e.g., Converted 'Extra-curriculars' (Yes/No) into binary 1/0]
