Student Habits & Performance Analysis
This project is a Python-based data analysis tool designed to explore the relationship between student habits and academic performance. It features a modular architecture, starting with an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) suite and a flexible Main Menu for further analysis and machine learning tasks.

## 🚀 Features
Automated EDA: Quick generation of dataset statistics, info, and missing value checks.

Visual Distributions: Automatic histogram generation for all numerical features.

Modular Design: Easily extendable via a dictionary-based menu system to add new analysis modules or ML models.
